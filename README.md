# My Title

The quick brown fox **jumped** over the lazy dog.
Notice that even though I am on a new
line in the text file when I view the readme file
on the right it is not on a new line.
Everything is still on one line. How do I get a
new line? I need TWO newlines in the text file.
Press enter twice.

Like this. *Now I am in a new paragraph.* Sometimes
you want people to see "old news" or a mistake so
often programmers use what is called a strike-
through font. For example. ~~The President of the US
is Trump.~~ The President of the US is Biden.

Someone once said
> TO BE OR NOT TO BE

whatever that means. We learnt in Linux to make 
a file you type into the terminal
```
nano myfile.txt
```
How do we make a link to google?
